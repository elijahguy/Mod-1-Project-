        <h1>Sneaker Guide 101</h1>
        <h2>This guide severs the purpose to keep you informed on all the latest sneaker lingo to keep up with the culture</h2>
        <h3>Teen Slang Circa 2010's</h3>
        <p>1 “.Deadstock”
        Deadstock, often shortened to just DS, is a term used to say 	that a pair of sneakers has never been worn. We're not exactly 	sure how it went from "dead stock" to "deadstock," but	sometimes you just have to say, "It's a sneakerhead thing." Contrary 	to what eBay may lead you to believe, a sneaker that has been 	tried on, let alone "worn only inside" is NOT deadstock.
    
        2. “Grails”
    A bucket list is a list of things you want to do before you kick the bucket. For sneakerheads, grails are the same, in the sense that they're the shoes you have to have before you die. Most grails tend to be uber-rare and extremely limited sneakers but for some sneakerheads, it can be that colorway that you can wear everyday and for others it's that old pair you had as a kid that you wish you would have held onto. Grails are the shoe that complete you... and your sneaker collection. (Not that your collection will ever be "complete" — stop lying to yourself already.
    
    
        3. “Hypebeast”
    You know that friend of yours that has to have every new limited release, even if it means selling the pair they just bought last week? The one that buys sneakers based on how many people on Twitter say it's cool? Yep, we all have them. A Hypebeast consumes hype and reacts accordingly. Never forget, as PM Dawn once said: "Don't believe the hype because if you do it might deceive you." And you thought they were one-hit wonders. And, as someone else once said about hype, "as an equal can I get this through to you?"
    
    
    
        4. “OGs”
    Originals. Not a retro, not a re-release, but the first time a shoe released is the only time a sneaker is called OG. It's like code, for original. Don't get caught slippin' and say a retro is an OG because the Twitter sneaker police will ridicule you, because, you know, they have nothing better to do.
    
    
    
        5. “Reseller”
    A reseller is someone who buys sneakers (usually in bulk) with the intent to sell them. Love them or hate them, they're a part of this sneaker thing and they're not going away. They make it hard  Some of them provide you with a chance to get OG releases that you won't find anywhere else. Others, they walk out of the local mall carting a full size run of those retros you won't be able to get, gloating and taking pics for Instagram along the way. Guess which type makes us bitter?

    <h1>Camping Out For "Kicks"</h1>
    <h2>The Art Of The Sneaker Line</h2> 
    <p>The internet and raffles are making the sneaker line-up an old concept, yet there's still many stores that offer the 'first come, first served' system. With the age of the bot upon us, the tried and true method of camping still remains the best way to guarantee yourself a pair on the day of release.
    
    To an ordinary person, lining up for sneakers seems like such a crazy concept. However, to us die-hard sneaker fans, the wait is definitely worth it.
    
    Lining up for kicks is something every sneaker enthusiast should experience at least once. The sheer rush you get after enduring a night on the streets to get your hands on that one pair is exhilarating. Being able to successfully participate in the age-old concept of the sneaker line is an art form; and following the correct procedure will ensure that your next camp-out is a success.
